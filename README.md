This is my output from following along at Tony's workshop on R (12th March 2020).
I hope it is legible, I tried commenting it as best as possible.

The slides that accompany these files are available at:

https://inov8.shinyapps.io/IntroR/_w_34070793/#(1)

These are a few exercises to follow, including:

	-introduction to data tables in R
	-running basic linear regression models
	-applying machine learning techniques to data sets

There is also a tutorial on how to use `shiny' which hosts the slides linked above.

Cheers,
Owen McBrien
